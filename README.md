# Phishing_Website_Detection_Using_Machine_Learning
Objective
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify websites as phishing or legitimate based on various URL features, domain information, and content analysis.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Phishing Website Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains various features of phishing and legitimate websites. 

Approach
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned by removing duplicates and normalizing the features.
Model: A deep neural network built using TensorFlow is used for binary classification, where the model predicts whether a website is phishing or legitimate.
Feature Engineering: Features such as URL length, domain information, and SSL status are used to train the model.
